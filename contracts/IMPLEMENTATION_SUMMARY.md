## 🎮 Game Instructions

### 1. `initialize_round`
**Purpose:** Create a new game round with configurable parameters

**Parameters:**
- `nonce: u8` - Round identifier for PDA derivation
- `commit_duration_secs: i64` - Duration of commit phase
- `reveal_duration_secs: i64` - Duration of reveal phase  
- `stake_lamports: u64` - Amount each player must stake (in lamports)
- `fee_basis_points: u16` - Fee percentage (basis points, max 2000 = 20%)

**Accounts:**
- `round` (PDA) - Initialized with seeds `["round", authority, nonce]`
- `treasury` - Receives fees
- `authority` - Round creator (signer)

**Validation:**
- ✅ `stake_lamports > 0`
- ✅ `commit_duration_secs > 0 && reveal_duration_secs > 0`
- ✅ `fee_basis_points <= 2000` (max 20%)

**Event:** `RoundCreated`

---

### 2. `commit_meow`
**Purpose:** Player commits their hidden choice by submitting a hash

**Parameters:**
- `commitment: [u8; 32]` - SHA256 hash of `(tribe || salt || player || round_id)`

**Accounts:**
- `round` - Round account (must be in CommitOpen status)
- `player_round` (PDA) - Initialized with seeds `["player_round", round, player]`
- `player` - Committing player (signer)

**Validation:**
- ✅ Round status is `CommitOpen`
- ✅ Current time <= `commit_deadline`
- ✅ Player hasn't already committed (commitment is all zeros)

**State Changes:**
- Transfers `stake_lamports` from player to round PDA
- Stores commitment in PlayerRound account

**Event:** `MeowCommitted`

---

### 3. `reveal_meow`
**Purpose:** Player reveals their choice by providing the preimage (tribe + salt)

**Parameters:**
- `tribe_value: u8` - Choice: 1 = Milk, 2 = Cacao
- `salt: [u8; 32]` - Random salt used in commitment

**Accounts:**
- `round` - Round account
- `player_round` - Player's round data (must have commitment)
- `player` - Revealing player (signer)

**Validation:**
- ✅ Current time > `commit_deadline` && <= `reveal_deadline`
- ✅ Player hasn't already revealed
- ✅ Player has a commitment
- ✅ **SHA256(tribe || salt || player || round_id) == stored_commitment**

**State Changes:**
- Sets `player_round.tribe` = Milk/Cacao
- Sets `player_round.revealed` = true
- Increments `round.milk_count` or `round.cacao_count`
- Adds stake to `round.milk_pool` or `round.cacao_pool`

**Event:** `MeowRevealed`

---

### 4. `settle_round`
**Purpose:** Determine winner after reveal phase ends

**Accounts:**
- `round` - Round account
- `treasury` - Receives fees

**Validation:**
- ✅ Current time > `reveal_deadline`
- ✅ Round status != `Settled`

**Logic:**
```rust
if milk_count == cacao_count {
    winner_side = None  // Tie - everyone who revealed gets refund
} else if milk_count < cacao_count {
    winner_side = Some(Milk)  // Milk is minority
} else {
    winner_side = Some(Cacao)  // Cacao is minority
}
```

**Fee Calculation:**
```rust
if winner_side.is_some() {
    total_pool = milk_pool + cacao_pool
    fee = (total_pool * fee_basis_points) / 10000
    transfer fee from round PDA to treasury
}
```

**State Changes:**
- Sets `round.winner_side`
- Sets `round.status` = Settled
- Transfers fee to treasury (if not a tie)

**Event:** `RoundMeowed`

---

### 5. `claim_treat`
**Purpose:** Winner claims reward or player claims refund (pull payment pattern)

**Accounts:**
- `round` - Round account (must be Settled)
- `player_round` - Player's round data
- `player` - Claiming player (signer)

**Validation:**
- ✅ Round status is `Settled`
- ✅ Player hasn't already claimed
- ✅ Player has a commitment

**Payout Logic:**

**Case 1: Tie (`winner_side == None`)**
```rust
if player revealed:
    amount = stake_lamports  // Full refund
else:
    amount = 0  // Non-revealers forfeit
```

**Case 2: Winner (player's tribe == winner_side)**
```rust
total_pool = milk_pool + cacao_pool
fee = (total_pool * fee_basis_points) / 10000
distributable = total_pool - fee

winner_pool = milk_pool or cacao_pool (winner's side)
amount = (distributable * stake_lamports) / winner_pool
```

**Case 3: Loser or Non-Revealer**
```rust
return Error (NotWinner or NoReward)
```

**State Changes:**
- Sets `player_round.claimed` = true
- Transfers lamports from round PDA to player

**Event:** `TreatClaimed`

## 🗂️ Account Structures

### Round (PDA Account)
**Seeds:** `["round", authority, nonce]`

```rust
pub struct Round {
    pub status: RoundStatus,           // CommitOpen | Settled
    pub commit_deadline: i64,          // Unix timestamp
    pub reveal_deadline: i64,          // Unix timestamp
    pub stake_lamports: u64,           // Fixed stake per player
    pub fee_basis_points: u16,         // Fee in basis points
    pub milk_count: u32,               // Number of Milk players
    pub cacao_count: u32,              // Number of Cacao players
    pub milk_pool: u64,                // Total lamports from Milk players
    pub cacao_pool: u64,               // Total lamports from Cacao players
    pub winner_side: Option<Tribe>,    // None = tie, Some = winner
    pub treasury: Pubkey,              // Treasury address
    pub bump: u8,                      // PDA bump seed
}
```

**Space:** `8 + 1 + 8 + 8 + 8 + 2 + 4 + 4 + 8 + 8 + 33 + 32 + 1 = ~125 bytes`

---

### PlayerRound (PDA Account)
**Seeds:** `["player_round", round, player]`

```rust
pub struct PlayerRound {
    pub commitment: [u8; 32],          // SHA256 hash
    pub tribe: Option<Tribe>,          // None | Some(Milk/Cacao)
    pub revealed: bool,                // Has player revealed?
    pub claimed: bool,                 // Has player claimed reward?
    pub round: Pubkey,                 // Round this belongs to
    pub player: Pubkey,                // Player address
    pub bump: u8,                      // PDA bump seed
}
```

**Space:** `8 + 32 + 33 + 1 + 1 + 32 + 32 + 1 = ~140 bytes`

---

## 🎲 Enums

### RoundStatus
```rust
pub enum RoundStatus {
    CommitOpen,  // Accepting commits
    Settled,     // Round settled, claims open
}
```

### Tribe
```rust
pub enum Tribe {
    Milk,   // Choice 1
    Cacao,  // Choice 2
}
```

---

## 📢 Events

All events are emitted via Anchor's `#[event]` macro and logged on-chain.

### RoundCreated

pub struct RoundCreated {
    pub round_id: Pubkey,
    pub stake_lamports: u64,
    pub commit_deadline: i64,
    pub reveal_deadline: i64,
    pub fee_basis_points: u16,
}
```

### MeowCommitted

}
```

### TreatClaimed

## ⚠️ Error Codes

```rust
pub enum GameError {
    InvalidStake,           // stake_lamports == 0
    InvalidDuration,        // duration <= 0
    FeeTooHigh,            // fee_basis_points > 2000 (20%)
    CommitClosed,          // Commit phase ended
    AlreadyCommitted,      // Player already committed
    RevealClosed,          // Reveal phase not open
    AlreadyRevealed,       // Player already revealed
    NoCommitment,          // No commitment found
    InvalidReveal,         // Hash mismatch
    InvalidTribe,          // tribe_value not 1 or 2
    RevealNotEnded,        // Reveal phase still open
    AlreadySettled,        // Round already settled
    NotSettled,            // Round not settled yet
    AlreadyClaimed,        // Player already claimed
    NotWinner,             // Player is loser
    NoReward,              // No reward to claim
}
```

---

## 🔐 Commitment Hash Function

**Required Format:** `SHA256(tribe || salt || player || round_id)`

**TypeScript Implementation:**
```typescript
function makeCommitment(
  tribe: number,           // 1 = Milk, 2 = Cacao
  salt: Buffer,            // 32 random bytes
  playerPubkey: PublicKey,
  roundPubkey: PublicKey
): Buffer {
  const data = Buffer.concat([
    Buffer.from([tribe]),
    salt,
    playerPubkey.toBuffer(),
    roundPubkey.toBuffer()
  ]);
  return Buffer.from(
    crypto.createHash("sha256").update(data).digest()
  );
}
```

**Rust Verification:**
```rust
use solana_program::hash::hash;

let mut data = Vec::new();
data.push(tribe_value);
data.extend_from_slice(&salt);
data.extend_from_slice(player.key().as_ref());
data.extend_from_slice(round.key().as_ref());

let computed_hash = hash(&data);
require!(
    computed_hash.to_bytes() == player_round.commitment,
    GameError::InvalidReveal
);
```

## 🧪 Test Coverage

### Test Suites

**1. Round Lifecycle**
- ✅ Initialize a new round
- ✅ Player 1 commits to Milk
- ✅ Player 2 commits to Cacao
- ✅ Reject double commit

**2. Reveal Phase**
- ✅ Players reveal their choices
- ✅ Reject invalid reveal (wrong salt/hash mismatch)
- ✅ Round state updates correctly (counts, pools)

**3. Settlement and Claims**
- ✅ Settle the round after reveal deadline
- ✅ Winner claims reward
- ✅ Loser cannot claim
- ✅ Reject double claim

### Edge Cases Tested
- ⚠️ Time validation (commit/reveal deadlines)
- ⚠️ Hash mismatch detection
- ⚠️ Double commit prevention
- ⚠️ Double claim prevention
- ⚠️ Loser claim rejection
- ⚠️ Tie handling (refunds)
