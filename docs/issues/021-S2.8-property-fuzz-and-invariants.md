## Context
Bảo toàn tiền, không overflow, tổng claim <= distributable.

## Scope
- Property-based tests
- Fuzz & invariant

## Acceptance Criteria
- Các thuộc tính an toàn giữ vững qua fuzz

## Tasks
- Viết property/invariant tests
- Tích hợp vào CI 

## Result
- Added property-based and invariant tests with Foundry:
	- Invariants in `contracts/test/InvariantChocoChoco.t.sol` using `StdInvariant`:
		- Native and ERC-20 suites with handlers that fuzz actions (commit/reveal/warp/settle/claim)
		- Invariant: total winners' claims per settled round never exceed distributable (total revealed pool minus fee)
	- Lightweight view helpers added to `ChocoChocoGame.sol` for invariant computations:
		- `getRoundStatus`, `getRoundTimes`, `getRoundConfig`, `getRoundPools`, `getRoundMeta`
- All tests pass locally: 30/30, including both invariant suites (256 runs each).

## Notes
- The invariant focuses on conservation for the winners' pool (excludes tie refunds and non-revealer refunds by design). Penalties are routed to treasury and do not affect the distributable bound.
- Suites cover both native-asset and ERC-20 modes to ensure consistency across asset types.
