# ChocoChoco Issues

This directory tracks project issues as markdown files (file-per-issue). They mirror sprint stories and tasks in `../..//SPRINT_PLAN.md`.

Conventions:
- File name: `NNN-<code>-<slug>.md` (NNN is zero-padded ordering)
- YAML front-matter: id, title, epic, sprint, estimate, labels, assignees, dependencies, status
- Body: context, scope, acceptance criteria, out-of-scope, notes

See sibling files for actual issues.
