# Changelog - Leaderboard & Simulator Integration

## [1.2.0] - 2025-01-XX

### ✨ New Features

#### 🏆 Unified Leaderboard System
- **Mixed Leaderboard Display**: Shows both real blockchain players and simulated AI players in a single ranking
- **Smart Filtering**: Toggle between "All Players", "Real Only", and "Simulated" views
- **Visual Indicators**: AI players marked with badge and distinct styling (purple text, "AI" badge)
- **Player Name Display**: Simulated users show as "SimUser_001", real players show truncated addresses

#### 🤖 Simulator Integration
- **Leaderboard Data Export**: Simulator now exports player stats to leaderboard
- **Stats Calculation**: Automatic calculation of total payout, win rate, claims for AI players
- **Quick Navigation**: Added "View Leaderboard" button in simulator header (appears when users initialized)

### 🔧 Technical Improvements

#### `game-simulator.ts`
- Added `getSimulatedLeaderboard()`: Fetches all simulated player stats
- Added `getMixedLeaderboard()`: Merges real and simulated data with proper ranking
- Fixed player stats calculation using `demo.getPlayerStats()`
- Calculate net profit: `currentBalance - initialBalance`

#### `leaderboard.tsx`
- Added data filter state: `'all' | 'real' | 'simulated'`
- Added `getPlayerDisplayName()`: Returns player name and isSimulated flag
- Updated Top Payout and Win Rate tables to show AI badge
- Filter UI only visible when simulator has users
- Smart data loading based on active filter

#### `Simulator.tsx`
- Added "View Leaderboard" button in header
- Button only appears when users initialized
- Better visual hierarchy with flex layout

### 📊 Data Flow

```
Simulator → localStorage (users) → demo-rounds.ts (game state)
                ↓
         getPlayerStats()
                ↓
    getSimulatedLeaderboard()
                ↓
     getMixedLeaderboard()
                ↓
         Leaderboard UI
```

### 🎨 UI/UX Improvements

- **AI Badge**: Small purple badge next to simulated player names
- **Color Coding**: Purple text for AI players, monospace for real players
- **Filter Buttons**: Clean button group with active state styling
- **Responsive Design**: Filter buttons stack on mobile
- **Visual Feedback**: Smooth transitions on filter toggle

### 📝 Documentation

Added three comprehensive guides:
- `LEADERBOARD_SIMULATOR_INTEGRATION.md`: Full technical documentation
- `INTEGRATION_SUMMARY.md`: Quick summary for developers
- `QUICK_START_SIMULATOR_LEADERBOARD.md`: User guide with visual examples

### 🐛 Bug Fixes

- Fixed player stats calculation to use correct field names from `getPlayerStats()`
- Fixed icon name issue (changed 'zap' to 'sparkles')
- Ensured proper re-ranking after data merge
- Added check for hasSimulatedUsers before showing filters

### 🔄 Changed Behavior

**Before:**
- Leaderboard only showed real blockchain players
- No connection between simulator and leaderboard
- No way to see AI player performance

**After:**
- Leaderboard shows both real and simulated players
- Simulated players clearly marked with AI badge
- Filter to toggle between all/real/simulated views
- Direct navigation from simulator to leaderboard

### ⚡ Performance

- Efficient stat calculation using existing `demo.getPlayerStats()`
- Minimal localStorage usage (only user info, not full game history)
- O(n) complexity for merging and sorting
- Pagination maintained (50 entries per page)

### 🧪 Testing

All TypeScript compilation errors resolved:
- ✅ `game-simulator.ts` - No errors
- ✅ `leaderboard.tsx` - No errors  
- ✅ `Simulator.tsx` - No errors

### 📦 Dependencies

No new dependencies added - uses existing:
- React state management
- localStorage API
- demo-rounds.ts game state
- indexer.ts API client

### 🚀 Deployment Notes

1. No database migration required
2. No backend changes needed
3. Frontend-only changes
4. Backward compatible (works with or without simulated users)
5. localStorage data persists across sessions

### 🔮 Future Enhancements

Potential additions:
- Real-time leaderboard updates during simulation
- Filter by AI strategy type
- Win rate trend charts over time
- Export leaderboard as CSV/JSON
- Performance comparison: real vs simulated
- Simulation history tracking
