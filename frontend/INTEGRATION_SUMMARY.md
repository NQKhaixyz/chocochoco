# ✅ Leaderboard-Simulator Integration Complete

## What Was Built

Integrated the **Game Simulator** (100 AI players) with the **Leaderboard** system to display both real blockchain players and simulated players in a unified ranking view.

## Key Features

### 1. **Mixed Leaderboard Display** 🏆
- Real players from blockchain indexer
- Simulated AI players from game simulator
- Merged and ranked together by performance

### 2. **Smart Filtering** 🎯
Three filter options:
- **All Players**: Shows everyone (real + simulated)
- **Real Only**: Blockchain players only
- **Simulated**: AI players only

### 3. **Visual Indicators** 🎨
Simulated players are clearly marked:
- Display name: `SimUser_001`, `SimUser_002`, etc.
- **AI Badge** next to their name
- Purple text color (vs monospace for real players)

### 4. **Two Leaderboard Tables** 📊

**Top Payout Table:**
- Total winnings
- Number of claims
- Last claim date
- Rank badges (🏆 🥈 🥉)

**Weekly Win Rate Table:**
- Win/Loss record
- Win rate percentage
- Performance stats

## How It Works

### Data Flow

```
┌─────────────────┐
│   Simulator     │ → Initialize 100 AI users
│   (/simulator)  │ → Run rounds (commit/reveal/claim)
└────────┬────────┘ → Store in localStorage
         │
         ↓
┌─────────────────┐
│  Leaderboard    │ → Load simulated users
│ (/leaderboard)  │ → Load real players (API)
└────────┬────────┘ → Merge & rank
         │
         ↓
    Display with
    filter options
```

### Key Functions

**`game-simulator.ts`:**
- `getSimulatedLeaderboard()`: Get stats for all AI players
- `getMixedLeaderboard(real, sim)`: Merge and re-rank both datasets

**`leaderboard.tsx`:**
- `getPlayerDisplayName(address)`: Check if player is simulated
- Filter logic: Toggle between all/real/simulated views

## Files Modified

### Core Logic
- ✅ `frontend/src/lib/game-simulator.ts` - Added leaderboard data functions
- ✅ `frontend/src/routes/leaderboard.tsx` - Added filter UI and mixed data loading
- ✅ `frontend/src/routes/Simulator.tsx` - Added "View Leaderboard" button

### Documentation
- ✅ `LEADERBOARD_SIMULATOR_INTEGRATION.md` - Full technical guide
- ✅ `INTEGRATION_SUMMARY.md` - This file

## Testing Steps

1. **Start dev server:**
   ```bash
   pnpm dev
   ```

2. **Initialize simulator:**
   - Go to `/simulator`
   - Click "Initialize Users" → Creates 100 AI players
   - Click "Run Continuous Simulation (5 rounds)"

3. **View leaderboard:**
   - Go to `/leaderboard`
   - See filter buttons at top
   - Toggle between "All", "Real Only", "Simulated"
   - Verify AI badge appears on simulated users
   - Check that SimUser names display correctly

4. **Verify integration:**
   - Stats match between simulator and leaderboard
   - Ranking is correct (highest payout/win rate at top)
   - Filter shows/hides players correctly
   - "View Leaderboard" button works from simulator

## Technical Highlights

### Player Stats Calculation
```typescript
const stats = demo.getPlayerStats(user.publicKey);
const totalPayout = currentBalance - initialBalance;
const winRate = (wins / roundsPlayed) * 100;
```

### Mixed Leaderboard Merge
```typescript
const mixedPayout = [...real, ...simulated]
  .sort((a, b) => Number(b.totalPayout - a.totalPayout))
  .slice(0, 50)
  .map((entry, index) => ({ ...entry, rank: index + 1 }));
```

### Player Name Display
```typescript
const displayInfo = getPlayerDisplayName(item.player);
// { name: "SimUser_001", isSimulated: true }

{displayInfo.isSimulated && <span className="badge">AI</span>}
```

## Strategy Distribution

100 AI users split into 4 strategies (25 each):
- **Random**: 50/50 chance
- **Minority Seeker**: Joins smaller tribe
- **Majority Follower**: Joins larger tribe  
- **Contrarian**: Does opposite

This creates diverse competition and varied win rates!

## Performance

- ✅ No TypeScript errors
- ✅ Efficient stat calculation (O(n))
- ✅ localStorage for persistence
- ✅ 50 entries per page (pagination)
- ✅ Re-ranking on filter change

## Next Steps (Optional)

Potential enhancements:
1. Real-time leaderboard updates during simulation
2. Filter by AI strategy type
3. Win rate trend charts
4. Export leaderboard as CSV
5. Compare real vs simulated performance

**Status**: ✅ **Integration Complete**  
**Zero TypeScript Errors**  
**Ready for Testing**
